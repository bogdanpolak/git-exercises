Paragraphs are separated by a blank line. Font styles: *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis. Unicode is supported. â˜º

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
